# AI-BUTLER 

Artificial Intelligence-Based Utility for Transformative Learning and Efficient Reasoning (AI-BUTLER) is an open-source project that aims to build a complex and efficient AI system capable of various tasks.

## Description 

AI-BUTLER proof of concept in the realm of generative artificial intelligence. This project is designed to harness and leverage the strengths of multiple AI systems to achieve specific objectives. It's built to incrementally enhance its performance by digesting and understanding more data, learning and adjusting its actions in response to fresh tasks and diverse data sources. The overarching goal of this project is to initially absorb basic functionality from other AI models, and subsequently use that acquired knowledge for independent learning. The project is intended to serve as a proof of concept in the exploration of AI's capacity for autonomous learning.
